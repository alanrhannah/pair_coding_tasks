Suppose we could access yesterdays stock prices as a list, where:
- The inidces are the time in minutes past trade opening time, 
  which was 9:30am local time.
- The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock at that time.
So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, ``stock_prices_yesterday[60] = 500``

Write and effcient function that takes stock_prices_yesterday and
returns the bost profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale
of Apple stock yesterday.

No "shorting" - you musy buy before you sell. You may not buy and sell
in the same time step, i.e. at least 1 minute must pass.

Example below:

"""

stock_prices_yesterday = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9]
get_max_profit(stock_prices_yesterday)
# returns 6 (Buying for $5 and selling for $11)
